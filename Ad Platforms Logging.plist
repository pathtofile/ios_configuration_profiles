		<string>The Ad Platforms Logging Profile generates files that allow Apple to troubleshoot issues with your device and help Apple to improve its products and services. The generated files may contain some non-identifiable personal information, including information about: your use of iTunes and the AppStore, the ads that are sent to your device and how you interact with them, and the IDs for the apps on your device that are using Ad Platforms. The profile will expire after 7 days.

            You will be able to turn on and off logging at any time while the Profile is installed, and will be able to review the log files on your computer prior to sending them to Apple.  To turn off logging, open Settings, tap General, tap "Profiles" tap "Ad Platforms Logging" and tap "Delete Profile."

            By enabling this diagnostic tool and sending a copy of the generated files to Apple, you are consenting to Apple's use of the content of such files in accordance with its privacy policy (http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy).
