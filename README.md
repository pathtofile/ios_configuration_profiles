# iOS Configuration Profiles

This repo contains the parsed PList data from [Apple's Developer Configuration Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/profiles-and-logs/?platform=ios).

Note that these aren't signed, so they can't be used on a device. To download the actual Configuration Profiles, click the above link and login with your developer ID.

Parsed using [this tool from yotamolenik](https://github.com/yotamolenik/mobileconfig).
