		<string>The ARKit Diagnostics Profile generates files that allow Apple to troubleshoot issues with your AR applications and help Apple to improve its products and services. While this profile is installed, the generated files may contain information about when and how long you used an AR application and what ARKit features were used by that app. The profile will expire after 3 days.

You will be able to turn on and off logging at any time while the Profile is installed, and will be able to review the log files on your computer prior to sending them to Apple. To turn off logging, open Settings, tap General, tap "Profiles," tap "ARKit/iOS Logging Profile," and tap "Delete Profile."

By enabling this diagnostic tool and sending a copy of the generated files to Apple, you are consenting to Apple's use of the content of such files in accordance with its privacy policy (http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy).
